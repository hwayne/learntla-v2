Action Properties
==================

In the :doc:`last chapter <temporal-logic>` I said that all invariants are safety properties, but not all safety properties are invariants. Outside invariants, the biggest class of safety properties are "action properties", which are restrictions on how the system is allowed to *change*.

Let's play a bit more with the threads spec:

.. spec:: action_props/threads_1/threads.tla
  :ss: threads_3

Here are a couple of restrictions on the way the spec should be allowed to change:

* ``counter`` should only increase.
* If a thread holds the lock, it *cannot* go to another thread without being unlocked first.

Here's how we write the first as an action property:

.. spec:: action_props/threads_2/threads.tla
  :diff: action_props/threads_1/threads.tla

Wait, *what*?

Don't worry, I'll explain this syntax in `the next section <action_prop_syntax>`. For now, let's confirm that this actually breaks. First make a change where counter decreases:

.. spec:: action_props/threads_3/threads.tla
  :diff: action_props/threads_2/threads.tla
  :fails:

Now run this with ``PROPERTY CounterOnlyIncreases`` (**not** as an invariant). If set up right, you should see this error:

.. code:: text

  \* some initial states
  State 7:
    /\ counter = 1
    /\ lock = 1
    /\ pc = <<"IncCounter", "Done">>
    /\ tmp = <<1, 0>>

  State 8:
    /\ counter = 0
    /\ lock = 1
    /\ pc = <<"ReleaseLock", "Done">>
    /\ tmp = <<1, 0>>

This doesn't fail because we have a state where the counter is 0. That's a totally valid state for the spec, and is in fact the starting state! It fails because counter *changes from 1 to 0*. It's the fact *counter decreases* that's an error.

.. digraph:: G
  :caption: None of these states are illegal, but the *transition* from ``counter=1`` to ``counter=0`` is.

  label="val: counter";
  0 -> 1 -> 2;
  1 -> 0[color=tomato];

Understanding the Syntax
-------------------------

On one hand, cool trick. On the other, we now have to figure out what ``[][counter' >= counter]_counter`` is supposed to mean.


......


It's finally time to talk about the "actions" in "Temporal Logic of Actions".

.. index:: ' (next value)
.. _prime:

So remember how way back I said that `strings must use double quotes <string>`? That's because single quotes have a special role in TLA+. In any given step, ``x'`` is the value of x at the *end of the step* and the value x starts as in the *next* step. ``[](x' >= x)``, then, is "it is always true that the *next value of x* is larger than or equal to x".

.. tip:: you can use primed operators in the `trace explorer <trace_explorer>`. It'll show you the value of the expression in the next step.

.. index:: UNCHANGED

But that's not (yet) a valid TLA+ property. Consider the slightly different property ``[](x' = x + 1)``: "x always increases by exactly one". What happens if we insert a `stutter step <stuttering>`? Then x doesn't change at all, which means that the property is false. But by the definition of TLA+, we can *always* insert a stutter step anywhere. So this property is *trivially* false. The more interesting property we actually wanted to check was ``[](x' # x => x' + 1)``. Alternatively, we can write this as ``x' > x \/ UNCHANGED x``.

.. index:: [P]_x
.. _box_action:

As yet more syntactic sugar, we can write ``[](x' = x + 1 \/ UNCHANGED x)`` as ``[][x' = x + 1]_x``. This is called a :dfn:`box action formula`. Box action formulas have a special role in TLA+, as we'll see in :doc:`the next chapter <tla>`. TLC can only check action properties that are box action formulas.

.. tip:: The underscory bit means that we could have written the property as ``[][counter' > counter]_counter``. Expanding all the steps: 

  #. ``[counter' > counter]_counter``
  #. ``counter' > counter \/ UNCHANGED counter``
  #. ``counter' > counter \/ counter' = counter``
  #. ``counter' >= counter``

  But in general, you shouldn't rely on that aspect of ``[]_x`` for your property. If it's okay for counter to stay the same, make that explicit.

More Action Properties
-----------------------

Let's add another property that "the lock can't go straight from one thread to another":

.. spec:: action_props/threads_4/threads.tla
  :diff: action_props/threads_3/threads.tla


And now we'll make a change that breaks this property:

.. spec:: action_props/threads_5/threads.tla
  :diff: action_props/threads_4/threads.tla


Running with ``PROPERTY LockCantBeStolen`` shows this fail.

.. digraph:: LockCantBeStolen
  :align: center

  rankdir=TB;
  label="val: lock";
  NULL -> {t1 t2};
  {t1 t2} -> NULL;
  t1 -> t2[color=tomato];

Another way we could have written the property:

.. spec:: action_props/threads_6/threads.tla
  :diff: action_props/threads_5/threads.tla

You *can* use helper actions in your action properties, so we could do something like

::

  BecomesNull(x) == x' = NULL

  LockCantBeStolen ==
     [][lock # NULL => BecomesNull(lock)]_lock

Quantified Action Properties
-----------------------------

I mentioned earlier that TLC can only check top-level action properties. This can make some things a little awkward. Let's write a quick spec with several independent counters:

.. spec:: action_props/counters_1/counters.tla
  :ss: action_prop_counter

As before, we want an action property saying that the counters are monotonic. Unlike before, we have several counters we need to quantify over.

.. spec:: action_props/counters_2/counters.tla
  :diff: action_props/counters_1/counters.tla
  :fails:

Unfortunately, TLC can't check this, due to limitations of the model checker. 

  [] followed by action not of form [A]_v.

(The error is a little confusing, but it happens whenever we put our action property inside a quantifier). 

What we can do in this case is pull the quantifier *inside* the action property. It turns out that ``[]`` commutes with ``\A``! In other words, any equation written ``\A x: []P(x)`` is *equivalent* to the formula ``[](\A x: P(x))``.

.. spec:: action_props/counters_3/counters.tla
  :diff: action_props/counters_2/counters.tla

Using Action Properties
=======================

Most of the specs I write have more invariants than action properties and more action properties than liveness properties. But liveness properties are arguably more "important" than action properties, as every spec needs at least one. Action props are powerful but optional.

Nonetheless, I love using action properties. They give you an incredible amount of flexibility for defining new properties.

Summary
========

- Action properties are properties on *transitions* of a system, and are checked as temporal properties.
- ``x'`` is the value of ``x`` in the *next* state. Operators with primes in them are called **Actions**.
- ``[P]_x`` means  ``P \/ UNCHANGED x``.
